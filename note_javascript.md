- Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    <b>Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads</b>

- <b>Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element</b> improves the display speed, because script compilation slows down the display.

- Using <b>document.write() after an HTML document</b> is fully <b>loaded</b>, will <b>delete all existing HTML</b>
